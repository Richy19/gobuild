Description
------------
gobuild is an automatic build tool that aims to replace Makefiles for simple
projects written in the Go programming language. It creates a dependency graph
of all local imports and compiles them in the right order using the gc Go
compiler.


Compiling
----------

gobuild comes with a Makefile, so running 'make' and 'make install' will build
and install it.

If you have an older version of gobuild, running gobuild without parameters
inside the source directory should be enough to compile it.


Usage
------

Building an executable:

For most simple applications it should be enough to run gobuild without any
parameters. If there are multiple main functions in different files you have to
give the file name for one or more of these files in the command line. You can
also build all of them with the -a option.

Files that are inside the main package but don't have a main function will be
included by default. To prevent this you can use the option -single-main.

Building a library:

Library files (.a) can be build by running 'gobuild -lib' inside the source
directory of your files. Each package will result in its own library file.
If you want to build only certain packages you can give their names as
parameters to gobuild.

Only pure Go code is supported right now. Building something that needs C code
won't work.

Parameters
-----------

> gobuild [options] [gofile(s)]
> gobuild -lib [options] [gopackage(s)]

 gofile(s)
        For building an executable you can give one or more go-file names
        that must have a main function inside. The resulting executable will
        be called after the filename, but without extension.
        This parameter is optional if there's only one main file or the
        parameter -a is given.
        
 gopackage(s)
        If building a library you can give a list of packages that should
        be build. Only those packages will be build into libraries.

 -a
        Build all executables.

 -clean
        Deletes all temporary files. Files are the same as "make clean" and
        it is possible that this will delete important files if called inside
        the wrong directory.

 -include-hidden
        Include files in hidden directories and hidden files.

 -lib
        Build all packages, excluding the main package, into library files (.a).
       
 -o filename/dir
        This parameter can either have a filename or a directory as parameter.
        File names only work for executables while directories will also work
        when building librarys.
        If building an executable without giving an output file name the default
        name will be the same as the .go file name without extension.
 
 -q
        Quiet mode, only print warnings and errors.

 -qq
        Quieter mode, only print errors.

 -single-main
        Don't include files from the main package without main function to
        the one with main function when compiling.

 -v
        Verbose mode, print debug messages.
